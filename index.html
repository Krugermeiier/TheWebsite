        <p>Hi, my name is Jeevat, but online I go as 'Krugermeiier'. I'm 16 and from Northeastern United States. <br> 
            I make random stuff sometimes, whether it's programs made mostly in Python or in JavaScript or other stuff like videos, games, and small art. <br>
        </p>

        <p>I started game development in 2017, and even though its now 2022, I have not that much to show for it. <br>
        Here's a brief timeline.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>2017</dt>
          <dd>-Made a small tech demo.</dd>
          <dt>2018</dt>
          <dd>-Made a game called 'Shadowclysm' for a school project.</dd>
          <dt>2019</dt>
          <dd>-Made a game called 'Magic Against the Horde' for a school project with friends.</dd>
          <dt>2020</dt>
          <dd>-Made what I believe as my most polished game, 'Gunshots, Gangsters, and the 60s Car' <br>
            for Ludum Dare 46 with the theme 'Keep it Alive'.</dd>
          <dt>2021</dt>
          <dd>-Made small tech demos and projects.</dd>
          <dt>2022</dt>
          <dd>-Same as 2021, nothing major to add.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>My username originates from <a href="https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Krugermeier_2-2">Hitman World of Assassination's Krugermeier</a>, a subsonic pistol that looks cool and is very useful. <br>
            I just thought it sounded cool and rolled with it. <br>
            The reason there is an extra i in my name is because the name 'Krugermeier' was taken like everywhere.
